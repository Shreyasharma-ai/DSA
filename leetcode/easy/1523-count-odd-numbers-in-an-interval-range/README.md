## Problem

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the  *count of odd numbers between* `low` *and* `high` *(inclusive)*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9
