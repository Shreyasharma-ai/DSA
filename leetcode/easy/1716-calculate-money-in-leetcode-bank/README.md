![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank  **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the  **previous Monday**.

Given `n`, return  *the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the* `nth` *day.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.

```
